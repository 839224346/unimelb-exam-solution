## Question 11

Tim is thinking of trying an autocratic leadership style for a Scrum project. Is this type of style appropriate for a Scrum project. Justify your answer.

--

No, the leadership style for a Scrum project is slave leadership.

Autocratic leadership means one person takes control of all the decision making.

This contradicts the principles of Scrum. Where power and control are shared within the team and every team member is involved in decision making.

## Question 12

Jesse would like to setup up a discussion with Tim (your boss) to discuss leadership styles and SDLCs. Write this email from Jesse to the boss Tim to set up this meeting. 

--

Hi Tim, 

I am writting to ask whether we can set up a meeting to discuss about the leadership styles and SDLCs of the project. I think using an autocratic leadership style for a Scrum project may bring nagetive effect. When would you be free?

Kind regards,

Jesse

## Question 14

You (Jesse) are working at DevSW and want to convince Tim to implement a Quality Assurance Process in a software project. List two advantages and two disadvantages of using a Quality Assurance Process in a software project.

--

**Advantages:**

Provide a framework around which the quality assurancess may be implemented

Provide encapsulation of best, or at least most appropriate, practice

**Disadvantages:**

Not seen as relevant and up-to-date by software engineers

Involve too much bureaucratic form filling

## Question 15

After Bob has completed 12 hours of work, what is the actual cost?

--

AC = 12 * $125 = 1500

---

## Question 16

However, Bob has only completed 20% of the task after 12 hours of work.

What is the earned value?

--

EV = 0.2 * $4500 = 900

---

## Question 17

Is the task on budget? What is the actual cost of the task if Bob continues the current work rate?

--

No, acutual cost is $7500 (if Bob continues the current work rate)

---

## Question 18

Is the task on schedule? How many hours do you estimate this task will take if Bob continues the current work rate? How would the schedule vary from the planned schedule?

--

No, the plan value(till now) is 1500. SV = EV-PV = -600. If Bob conunues the current work rate. It will takes 60 hours.

---

Project A is a Scrum project which has a Product Backlog consisting of the User Stories and estimated Story Points given in the table below.

**Sprint Backlog**

**User Story -Story Points**

Story1 - 3

Story2 - 5

Story3 - 13

Story4 - 8

Story5 - 1

Story6 - 3

Story7 - 2

An established development team has an average velocity of seven (7) User Story Points per fortnight.

## Question 19

Describe how one would compute the *average velocity* of an agile team.

--

1. Use the knowledge of previous project done by the team to estimate the velocity.
2. Use the burndown chart in the previous sprint to estimate the velocity.

---

## Question 20

Estimate how many weeks this team will take to deliver Project A.

--

3 + 5 + 13 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 35

35 / 7 * 2 = 10 weeks

## Question 21

If the team actually takes two weeks to complete the first two User Stories, what is the actual velocity of the team?

--

(3 + 5) / 1 = 8 (story point per fortnight)

## Question 22

If a new 5 Story Point User Story is added at the start of week 3, then in how many weeks do you estimate this Sprint will take to be delivered now?

--

Suppose the question 22 is following question 21, which get a new velocity of 8 story point fortnight.

35 + 5 = 40

40 / 8 * 2 = 10 weeks

## Question 23

Identify three major risks for the project, and state what impact each risk will have on the project or the product.

--

1. Michael Mac may fail to provide core features on time because of lack of supervision. Impact: Delay the project schedule.
2. Some of the student in the team may be unable to come back to school because of unforeseen situation like covid-19. Impact: the student have to work from remote place which have negative effect on communication.
3. The students may not have enough knowledge about Temporal Bone Surgery and develop some unreliable features. Impact: the unreliable features need to be redesign and develop again.

## **Question 24**

For each of your risks, give a strategy to handle the risk. State what type of strategy each is.

--

1. Avoid: Pay more attention to whether Michael Mac finish his jobs on schedule. Provide more supervision on Him.
2. Mitigate: Provide optional remote communication plan to reduce the impact of the risk;
3. Avoid: Ask the expert in this field carefully and provide detailed documentation for professional feature requirement.

## Question 25

Choose a SDLC for the project and justify your choice

--

Waterfall

1. The requirements of the project is clear. The customer has a very clear view of what they want.

2. The project will require little or no change to requirements since many of them has been defined in detail. The software requirements are clearly defined and documented.
3. The project take a year-long to finish may be a large scale application. Waterfall is a formal model.  Formal Model is suit for large scale application.

## Question 26

Design and justify a suitable team structure that is appropriate for your team and your choice of SDLC. Identify which role each team member will take.

--

Since there is not many people in the team. I suggest people in the team play multiple roles.

Steward Edward: Project Manager, Technical Team Leader, Architect

Emily Gardner: Requirement Manager, Configuration Manager

Audrey Count: Programmer, Tester

Michael Mac: Programmer, GUI

## **Question 27**

Does your chosen SDLC and the team structure help mitigate all or some of the identified risks? Explain.

Yes. Using Waterfall can generate enough document and standard for a better supervision for Michael Mac. And clear and detailed document can help the programmer to develop the correct features. Also optional communication plan can be completed at the beginning so we can handle this risk at anytime we want.
